# CF7 Mate — Marketing Copy

Use this for landing pages, WordPress.org description, sales pages, and feature comparison tables.

---

## 1. What product or service you're selling

**CF7 Mate** is a WordPress plugin that turns Contact Form 7 into a full-featured form toolkit **inside the Divi Builder**. You get:

- **Visual form styling** — Style CF7 forms with Divi’s native module (no code).
- **Extra form fields and behavior** — Star ratings, range sliders, multi-step forms, conditional logic, phone fields, calculators, and more.
- **Form entries** — Save submissions to the database and export to CSV (Pro).
- **Design presets** — One-click looks (Classic, Box, Typeform-style, etc.) plus full custom control.
- **Divi 4 & 5** — Works with both Divi 4 and Divi 5.

So you’re selling: **a CF7 + Divi companion** (styling + fields + entries + presets + AI form generation), not just a “styler.”

## 2. Target audience

- **Divi users** who already use or want to use Contact Form 7.
- **Agencies and freelancers** building client sites on Divi who need branded, flexible contact/lead forms.
- **Small businesses and site owners** on Divi who want forms that match their design without coding.
- **E‑commerce / service / lead-gen sites** that need: multi-step forms, conditional logic, star ratings, quotes/calculators, or stored entries.

**Ideal customer:** “I use Divi and Contact Form 7. I want my forms to look great, support advanced fields (ratings, sliders, steps, logic), and optionally save entries — all without leaving the Divi Builder.”

## 3. Key value proposition

**Why choose CF7 Mate?**

- **One place for CF7 + Divi** — Style and extend Contact Form 7 entirely from the Divi Builder; no switching between plugins for layout and look.

### Icons or illustrations to use

- **Existing in plugin:** The admin app already uses SVG feature icons for: module, grid, columns, steps, star, database, slider, phone, separator, heading, image, icon, calculator, conditional, AI. Reuse these for consistency (see `src/admin/components/icons/FeatureIcons.js`).
- **Landing page / marketing:**
  - **Hero:** Divi builder + form preview (e.g. styled contact form on one side, Divi panel on the other).
  - **Styling:** Before/after (plain CF7 form vs styled with CF7 Mate), or a single “design panel” illustration.
  - **Fields:** Small icons per feature (star, slider, steps, phone, calculator, database, AI sparkle).
  - **Entries:** Simple table/list or inbox illustration with “Export CSV” or download arrow.
- **Style:** Match Divi’s clean, modern UI; avoid clip art. Line icons or simple flat illustrations work well.

### Suggested grouping for a features page or table

**Section 1 — Styling & layout**  
CF7 Styler module • Grid layout • Multi-column (Pro) • Design presets (Pro)

**Section 2 — Form fields & behavior**  
Star rating • Range slider • Separator • Image • Icon • Heading (Pro) • Phone number (Pro) • Multi-step forms (Pro) • Conditional logic (Pro) • Calculator (Pro)

**Section 3 — Data & productivity**  
Form entries (Pro) • AI form generator (Pro)

You can also keep a **Free vs Pro** table (as in the admin) and add a **“By category”** view (Styling / Fields / Data) for users who think in tasks rather than tiers.
