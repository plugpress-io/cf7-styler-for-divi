Grid Layout
===========

What it is
  Puts form fields in a responsive grid so you can show several fields in one row (e.g. two or three columns) instead of a single column.

How to use
  1. Add the CF7 Styler module to your page in Divi.
  2. Select your Contact Form 7 form.
  3. In the module’s Design or Layout settings, look for grid/column options (e.g. number of columns, gap).
  4. Set how many columns you want on desktop; the layout usually stacks on smaller screens.
  5. Save. Your form fields will follow the grid you set.

Best for forms with many short fields (name, email, phone in one row).
