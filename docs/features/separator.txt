Separator Field
================

What it is
  A horizontal line (divider) between parts of the form. No input; it only visually splits sections.

How to use
  1. Edit your Contact Form 7 form (Contact → Contact Forms).
  2. Use the CF7 Mate Separator tag generator to insert a separator tag where you want the line (e.g. between "Personal info" and "Message").
  3. Save the form.
  4. Add the form to a page with the CF7 Styler module. You can style the line (thickness, color) in the module’s design options.

Helps long forms feel organized and easier to scan.
