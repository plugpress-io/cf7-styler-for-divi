Star Rating Field
=================

What it is
  A field that lets visitors choose a rating (e.g. 1–5 stars) instead of typing. Good for reviews and feedback.

How to use
  1. In WordPress admin go to Contact → Contact Forms and edit a form (or create one).
  2. In the form editor, click the "CF7 Mate" or "Star Rating" tag button to open the tag generator.
  3. Add a star rating field: set name, number of stars, and optional default. Insert the tag into the form.
  4. Save the form.
  5. Add the form to a page with the CF7 Styler module in Divi. The star rating appears and can be styled in the module’s design options.

The value sent in the submission is the selected number (e.g. 4 for 4 stars).
