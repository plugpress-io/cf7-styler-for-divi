Calculator / Price Estimator (Pro)
===================================

What it is
  Live calculation on the form: user fills in numbers (e.g. quantity, options) and sees a total or estimate update as they type. The result can be sent with the submission or shown only on screen.

How to use
  1. Enable "Calculator / Price Estimator" in CF7 Mate → Modules (Pro).
  2. Edit your Contact Form 7 form. Add the calculator/price tag via the CF7 Mate tag generator: define which fields are inputs and how to compute the result (formula or rules).
  3. Insert the tag and save the form.
  4. Add the form with the CF7 Styler module. The calculated value updates in real time; style the output in the module if needed.

Use it for quotes, order totals, or any form where you want an instant total from user inputs.
