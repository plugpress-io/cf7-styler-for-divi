Image Field
===========

What it is
  Inserts an image inside the form (e.g. a product photo, diagram, or instruction graphic). The image is display-only; it does not collect data.

How to use
  1. Edit your Contact Form 7 form (Contact → Contact Forms).
  2. Use the CF7 Mate Image tag generator: choose or upload an image, set size/alignment if available. Insert the tag.
  3. Save the form.
  4. Place the form with the CF7 Styler module on a page. Use the module’s design options to adjust image size or spacing if needed.

Use it to show what you’re asking about or to break up long forms.
