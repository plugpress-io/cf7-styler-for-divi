Design Presets (Pro)
====================

What it is
  Ready-made form styles (e.g. minimal, bold, dark) that you apply with one click. The preset sets colors, spacing, and field look so you don’t style from scratch.

How to use
  1. Enable "Presets" (or the design presets feature) in CF7 Mate → Modules (Pro).
  2. Add the CF7 Styler module to a page and select your form.
  3. In the module’s design or content settings, find the Preset option. Choose a preset (e.g. Minimal, Rounded, Dark).
  4. Save. The form updates to that style. You can then tweak individual options if you want.

Use it to get a consistent, professional look quickly or to try different styles before customizing.
