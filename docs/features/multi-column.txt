Multi Column (Pro)
==================

What it is
  Advanced control over form columns and breakpoints so you can build multi-column layouts that change at different screen sizes (e.g. 3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile).

How to use
  1. Enable "Multi Column" in CF7 Mate → Modules (Pro).
  2. Add the CF7 Styler module to a page in Divi and select your form.
  3. In the module’s layout/design settings, use the column and breakpoint options to set how many columns show at each width.
  4. Save. The form will follow your column rules on different devices.

Use when you need precise control beyond the basic grid (e.g. different column counts per breakpoint).
