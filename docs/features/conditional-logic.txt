Conditional Logic (Pro)
========================

What it is
  Shows or hides form fields based on what the user chose in another field (e.g. show "Company name" only if "Are you a business?" is Yes).

How to use
  1. Enable "Conditional Logic" in CF7 Mate → Modules (Pro).
  2. In your Contact Form 7 form, add the fields that will control visibility (e.g. dropdown or radio) and the fields that should show only in certain cases.
  3. Use the conditional logic tag or shortcode to define rules: "Show field X when field Y equals Z." (Exact syntax depends on the tag generator or docs.)
  4. Save the form and add it with the CF7 Styler module. Conditional fields appear or disappear as the user changes the controlling field.

Reduces clutter and makes long forms feel shorter by showing only relevant questions.
