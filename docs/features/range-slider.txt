Range Slider Field
==================

What it is
  A slider control so users pick a value within a range (e.g. 0–100) by dragging. No typing needed.

How to use
  1. Edit a Contact Form 7 form (Contact → Contact Forms).
  2. Open the CF7 Mate / Range Slider tag generator and add a slider: set name, min, max, default, and step.
  3. Insert the generated tag into the form and save.
  4. Place the form on a page with the CF7 Styler module. Style the slider in the module’s design settings if needed.

Use it for things like satisfaction (0–10), budget range, or quantity when a slider is clearer than a number input.
