Phone Number Field (Pro)
========================

What it is
  A phone input with country selector (and often flags). Users pick country code and type their number; the value is sent in a consistent format.

How to use
  1. Enable "Phone Number Field" in CF7 Mate → Modules (Pro).
  2. Edit a Contact Form 7 form (Contact → Contact Forms). Use the CF7 Mate Phone Number tag generator: set the field name and any default country. Insert the tag.
  3. Save the form.
  4. Add the form with the CF7 Styler module. Style the phone field in the module’s design options if needed.

Use it anywhere you collect phone numbers so you get country code + number without extra plugins.
