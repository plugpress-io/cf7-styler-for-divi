Multi Step Forms (Pro)
======================

What it is
  Splits one form into several steps (screens). Users click Next/Back. A progress indicator can show how far they are. All data is submitted together at the end.

How to use
  1. Enable "Multi Step Forms" in CF7 Mate → Modules (Pro).
  2. In your Contact Form 7 form, add the step tags (e.g. [step 1], [step 2]) where each step should start. Use the CF7 Mate tag generator or shortcode as documented for multi-step.
  3. Save the form.
  4. Add the form to a page with the CF7 Styler module. The module will show one step at a time with Next/Back; you can style the progress indicator in the module settings.

Best for long forms (e.g. surveys, applications) to reduce overwhelm and increase completion.
