Style and enhance Contact Form 7 for Divi, Bricks, Elementor, Gutenberg, and more.

== Description ==

**CF7 Mate** (formerly CF7 Styler for Divi) is an all-in-one toolkit for Contact Form 7. Customize every aspect of your forms visually — no CSS needed — and unlock powerful features like form entries, star ratings, range sliders, and multi-step forms.

Works with **Divi 4 & 5**, **Gutenberg**, **Elementor**, and **Bricks**.

= Why CF7 Mate? =

Contact Form 7 is powerful but ships with minimal styling. CF7 Mate bridges that gap by giving you full visual control over how your forms look and behave — directly inside the page builder you already use.

= Free Features =

* **Visual Form Styling** — Customize colors, spacing, borders, and typography for every form element
* **Multi-Builder Support** — Native modules for Divi (4 & 5), Gutenberg block, Elementor widget, and Bricks element
* **Form Header** — Add titles, descriptions, icons, or images above your form
* **Grid Layout** — Arrange fields in responsive multi-column grids
* **Field Styling** — Control background, borders, focus states, height, and spacing
* **Button Styling** — Customize text color, background, padding, border radius, and hover effects
* **Label & Placeholder Styling** — Fine-tune label color, spacing, and placeholder appearance
* **Radio & Checkbox Styling** — Custom sizes, colors, and border styles for radio buttons and checkboxes
* **Validation Messages** — Style success, error, and field-level validation messages
* **Responsive** — All styles adapt to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens
* **Lightweight** — No bloat. Only loads assets on pages that use your forms

= Pro Features =

* **Form Entries** — Save every submission to your WordPress database and export to CSV
* **Multi-Step Forms** — Build wizard-style forms with progress indicators and step navigation
* **Multi-Column Layouts** — Advanced column arrangements with custom responsive breakpoints
* **Star Rating Field** — Collect feedback and reviews with customizable star ratings

= Who Is This For? =

* Agencies building branded forms for clients
* Online stores that need styled order or inquiry forms
* Service businesses collecting leads through custom contact forms
* Anyone using Contact Form 7 who wants better-looking forms without writing CSS

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin from the WordPress plugin directory or upload the files to `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress.
3. Make sure [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) is installed and active.
4. Open your preferred page builder and look for the **CF7 Mate** module, block, widget, or element.

= Requirements =

* WordPress 5.6 or higher
* PHP 7.4 or higher
* Contact Form 7 plugin (active)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need Divi to use this plugin? =

No. CF7 Mate works with Divi, Gutenberg (WordPress block editor), Elementor, and Bricks. You only need one of these builders installed.

= Does this work with the default WordPress editor? =

Yes. CF7 Mate includes a Gutenberg block that works in the standard WordPress block editor — no additional page builder required.

= Is this compatible with Divi 5? =

Yes. CF7 Mate has a dedicated module built specifically for Divi 5, alongside continued support for Divi 4.

= Does this replace Contact Form 7? =

No. CF7 Mate extends Contact Form 7. You still create and manage your forms in CF7 — this plugin adds styling and extra features on top.

= Why did the name change from CF7 Styler to CF7 Mate? =

The plugin has grown well beyond styling. With form entries, star ratings, multi-step forms, calculators, and more, the new name better reflects everything it does.

= Can I use this on multiple sites? =

The free version can be used on unlimited sites. Pro license terms depend on your plan.

= Where can I get support? =
